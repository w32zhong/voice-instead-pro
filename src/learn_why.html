<h3>A letter form the author</h3>
<p>With the recent fast growing number of weekly users (reaching more than 100K already), the author observes excessive usage frequency on one or two top-rated APIs. Please notice those APIs are free services and they are collected from the Internet. With the increasing number of users, their serivce becomes less stable due to heavy traffic, this greatly damages experience of all VI users. As examples, users may experience pause-in-the-middle problem, moreover, providers will potentially deny our frequent requests to particular API (one example is Amazon Polly Mathew).</p>
<p>Therefore, the author decides to randomly distribute and constrain users to a limited set of choices among all available APIs, while at the same time offering option to <a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/voice-instead/kphdioekpiaekpmlkhpaicehepbkccbf/">upgrade/subscribe</a> VI with a fee of $2.99 per year for those who want to access or heavily use one or two of the best APIs.</p>
<img style="float:left" src="icon48.png"/>
<p>Voice Instead starts from a personal side project, it is introduced into Chrome Web Store from 2013, free of charge.
Since then, the author invests hours of time fixing bugs and improving VI. Maintaining this software is not easy as it looks like, it actually involves a lot of efforts without paying. Please understand author's decision and continue to support VI and the author will definitely be thankful if you are going to pay and subscribe this extension.</p>

<br/>
Best regards,
<br/>
